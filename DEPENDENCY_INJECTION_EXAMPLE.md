# Dependency Injection Refactoring: Before/After Example

This document demonstrates the complete transformation from tight coupling to dependency injection patterns in the Weather Dashboard application.

## 🎯 Dependency Injection Goals Achieved

✅ **Replace direct instantiation with dependency injection containers**  
✅ **Implement interface-based design for all major services**  
✅ **Create configurable service registration and resolution**  
✅ **Enable easy mocking and testing of components**  
✅ **Establish clear service lifetimes and scoping**

## 📋 BEFORE: Tight Coupling Pattern

### ❌ Original WeatherDashboard Class (Problematic)

```python
# BEFORE: Direct instantiation creates tight coupling
class WeatherDashboardApp:
    def __init__(self):
        # ❌ PROBLEMS:
        # - Direct instantiation creates tight coupling
        # - Hard-coded dependencies make testing difficult
        # - No configuration flexibility
        # - Services can't be easily swapped or mocked
        
        self.weather_service = OpenWeatherService()      # ❌ Tight coupling
        self.cache = MemoryCache()                       # ❌ Hard to test
        self.database = SQLiteDatabase("weather.db")     # ❌ No configuration
        self.logger = FileLogger("app.log")             # ❌ Fixed implementation
        
        # ❌ Services are created regardless of environment
        self.gemini_service = GeminiService(api_key="hardcoded")  # ❌ Security risk
        self.github_service = GitHubService(token="hardcoded")    # ❌ Security risk
    
    def initialize_services(self):
        """❌ PROBLEMS: Services already instantiated, no flexibility"""
        # Services are already created - no way to configure or mock them
        pass
    
    def get_weather(self, location: str):
        """❌ PROBLEMS: Directly coupled to concrete implementation"""
        try:
            # ❌ Directly calling concrete service
            return self.weather_service.fetch_weather(location)
        except Exception as e:
            # ❌ Hard to test error scenarios
            self.logger.error(f"Weather fetch failed: {e}")
            return None
```

### ❌ Problems with Original Approach:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Classes directly instantiate their dependencies
2. **Hard to Test**: Cannot easily mock services for unit testing
3. **No Configuration**: Services use hard-coded settings
4. **Security Issues**: API keys and tokens are hard-coded
5. **No Environment Support**: Same services used in dev/test/prod
6. **Resource Waste**: All services created even if not needed
7. **No Lifetime Management**: Services live for entire application lifetime

## 📋 AFTER: Dependency Injection Pattern

### ✅ Refactored WeatherDashboard Class (Solution)

```python
# AFTER: Dependency injection with interfaces
class WeatherDashboardApp:
    def __init__(self, environment: str = 'production'):
        """✅ SOLUTIONS:
        - Environment-based configuration
        - Services resolved from dependency container
        - Interface-based design enables testing
        - Proper service lifetime management
        """
        self.environment = environment
        self.container = get_container()
        self.service_registry = get_service_registry()
        
        # ✅ Services will be injected via dependency container
        self._config_service: Optional[IConfigurationService] = None
        self._logger: Optional[ILoggingService] = None
        self._database: Optional[IDatabase] = None
        self._weather_service: Optional[IWeatherService] = None
        self._cache_service: Optional[ICacheService] = None
        
        # ✅ Configure services based on environment
        self._configure_services()
        
        # ✅ Resolve core services from container
        self._resolve_core_services()
    
    def _configure_services(self):
        """✅ SOLUTIONS: Environment-specific service configuration"""
        if self.environment == 'production':
            configure_for_production()
        elif self.environment == 'development':
            configure_for_development(use_mock_external=True)
        elif self.environment == 'testing':
            configure_for_testing()  # All mocked services
    
    def _resolve_core_services(self):
        """✅ SOLUTIONS: Services resolved from container with interfaces"""
        # ✅ Interface-based resolution enables easy testing and swapping
        self._config_service = self.container.resolve(IConfigurationService)
        self._logger = self.container.resolve(ILoggingService)
        self._database = self.container.resolve(IDatabase)
        self._weather_service = self.container.resolve(IWeatherService)
        self._cache_service = self.container.resolve(ICacheService)
    
    def get_weather(self, location: str):
        """✅ SOLUTIONS: Uses injected interface, easy to test"""
        try:
            # ✅ Using injected interface - can be easily mocked
            weather_data = await self._weather_service.get_current_weather(location)
            
            # ✅ Using injected logger with structured logging
            self._logger.info("Weather data retrieved successfully", 
                            location=location, 
                            temperature=weather_data.temperature)
            
            return weather_data
        except Exception as e:
            # ✅ Proper error handling with injected logger
            self._logger.error("Weather fetch failed", 
                             location=location, 
                             error=str(e))
            return None
```

### ✅ Benefits of New Approach:

1. **Loose Coupling**: Services injected through interfaces
2. **Easy Testing**: Services can be easily mocked
3. **Configuration-Driven**: Services configured based on environment
4. **Security**: API keys loaded from secure configuration
5. **Environment Support**: Different services for dev/test/prod
6. **Resource Efficiency**: Only needed services are created
7. **Proper Lifetime Management**: Singleton, transient, and scoped services

## 🏗️ Dependency Injection Infrastructure

### Core Interfaces (`src/core/interfaces.py`)

```python
# ✅ Interface-based design enables loose coupling
class IWeatherService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_current_weather(self, location: str) -> WeatherDataDTO:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_forecast(self, location: str, days: int = 5) -> List[WeatherDataDTO]:
        pass

class IDatabase(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save_weather_data(self, weather_data: WeatherDataDTO) -> bool:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_recent_weather_data(self, limit: int = 10) -> List[WeatherDataDTO]:
        pass

class ICacheService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def set(self, key: str, value: Any, ttl: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
        pass
```

### Dependency Container (`src/core/dependency_container.py`)

```python
# ✅ Professional dependency injection container
class DependencyContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self._services: Dict[Type, ServiceRegistration] = {}
        self._instances: Dict[Type, Any] = {}
        self._resolution_stack: List[Type] = []
    
    def register_singleton(self, interface: Type[T], implementation: Type[T]) -> 'DependencyContainer':
        """✅ Register service with singleton lifetime"""
        self._services[interface] = ServiceRegistration(
            interface=interface,
            implementation=implementation,
            lifetime=ServiceLifetime.SINGLETON
        )
        return self
    
    def register_transient(self, interface: Type[T], implementation: Type[T]) -> 'DependencyContainer':
        """✅ Register service with transient lifetime"""
        self._services[interface] = ServiceRegistration(
            interface=interface,
            implementation=implementation,
            lifetime=ServiceLifetime.TRANSIENT
        )
        return self
    
    def resolve(self, interface: Type[T]) -> T:
        """✅ Resolve service with proper lifetime management"""
        if interface in self._resolution_stack:
            raise CircularDependencyError(f"Circular dependency detected: {' -> '.join([t.__name__ for t in self._resolution_stack])} -> {interface.__name__}")
        
        if interface not in self._services:
            raise DependencyResolutionError(f"Service {interface.__name__} is not registered")
        
        registration = self._services[interface]
        
        # Handle singleton lifetime
        if registration.lifetime == ServiceLifetime.SINGLETON:
            if interface not in self._instances:
                self._resolution_stack.append(interface)
                try:
                    self._instances[interface] = self._create_instance(registration)
                finally:
                    self._resolution_stack.pop()
            return self._instances[interface]
        
        # Handle transient lifetime
        elif registration.lifetime == ServiceLifetime.TRANSIENT:
            self._resolution_stack.append(interface)
            try:
                return self._create_instance(registration)
            finally:
                self._resolution_stack.pop()
```

### Service Registry (`src/core/service_registry.py`)

```python
# ✅ Environment-specific service configuration
def configure_for_production(config_path: Optional[str] = None, 
                           database_path: Optional[str] = None,
                           cache_dir: Optional[str] = None):
    """✅ Configure services for production environment"""
    container = get_container()
    
    # ✅ Register real implementations for production
    container.register_singleton(IConfigurationService, ConfigurationServiceImpl)
    container.register_singleton(ILoggingService, LoggingServiceImpl)
    container.register_singleton(IDatabase, DatabaseImpl)
    container.register_singleton(IWeatherService, WeatherServiceImpl)
    container.register_singleton(ICacheService, CacheServiceImpl)
    
    # ✅ External services with real implementations
    container.register_transient(IGeminiService, GeminiServiceImpl)
    container.register_transient(IGitHubService, GitHubServiceImpl)
    container.register_transient(ISpotifyService, SpotifyServiceImpl)

def configure_for_testing():
    """✅ Configure services for testing environment with mocks"""
    container = get_container()
    
    # ✅ Register mock implementations for testing
    container.register_singleton(IConfigurationService, MockConfigurationService)
    container.register_singleton(ILoggingService, MockLoggingService)
    container.register_singleton(IDatabase, MockDatabase)
    container.register_singleton(IWeatherService, MockWeatherService)
    container.register_singleton(ICacheService, MockCacheService)
    
    # ✅ Mock external services for testing
    container.register_transient(IGeminiService, MockGeminiService)
    container.register_transient(IGitHubService, MockGitHubService)
    container.register_transient(ISpotifyService, MockSpotifyService)
```

## 🧪 Testing Benefits

### ❌ Before: Hard to Test

```python
# ❌ BEFORE: Testing was difficult due to tight coupling
class TestWeatherDashboard(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_get_weather(self):
        # ❌ PROBLEMS:
        # - Real services are instantiated
        # - Network calls are made during tests
        # - Hard to simulate error conditions
        # - Tests are slow and unreliable
        
        app = WeatherDashboardApp()  # ❌ Creates real services
        weather = app.get_weather("London")  # ❌ Makes real API call
        
        # ❌ Test depends on external API availability
        self.assertIsNotNone(weather)
```

### ✅ After: Easy to Test

```python
# ✅ AFTER: Testing is easy with dependency injection
class TestWeatherDashboard(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # ✅ SOLUTIONS:
        # - Mock services are automatically injected
        # - No network calls during tests
        # - Easy to simulate any scenario
        # - Tests are fast and reliable
        
        configure_for_testing()  # ✅ Configures all mock services
        self.app = WeatherDashboardApp(environment='testing')
    
    def test_get_weather_success(self):
        # ✅ Mock service returns predictable data
        weather = self.app.get_weather("London")
        
        # ✅ Test is fast and reliable
        self.assertIsNotNone(weather)
        self.assertEqual(weather.location, "London")
        self.assertEqual(weather.temperature, 20.0)  # From mock
    
    def test_get_weather_api_error(self):
        # ✅ Easy to simulate error conditions
        mock_weather_service = self.app.container.resolve(IWeatherService)
        mock_weather_service.should_fail = True
        
        weather = self.app.get_weather("London")
        
        # ✅ Test error handling without real API failures
        self.assertIsNone(weather)
    
    def test_weather_caching(self):
        # ✅ Easy to test caching behavior
        mock_cache = self.app.container.resolve(ICacheService)
        
        # First call
        weather1 = self.app.get_weather("London")
        
        # Second call should use cache
        weather2 = self.app.get_weather("London")
        
        # ✅ Verify caching behavior
        self.assertEqual(mock_cache.get_call_count("weather:London"), 1)
```
