## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Features

#### Weather Service Integration
```python
def setup_weather_integration(self):
    """Connect weather service to UI"""
    # Handles button clicks and Enter key presses
    # Validates input and manages API calls
    # Updates UI with real weather data
```

#### State Management

```python
def show_loading_state(self, city):
    """Show loading with 3D styling"""
    # Disables button during API call
    # Shows loading message with city name
    # Applies Hunter theme colors

def show_success_state(self):
    """Show success state"""
    # Confirms successful data retrieval
    # Re-enables button for next search
    # Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds

def show_error_state(self, error_message):
    """Show error state"""
    # Shows specific error messages
    # Maintains Hunter theme styling
    # Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
```

#### Weather Display Update

```python
def update_weather_display_with_data(self, weather_data):
    """Update 3D weather display with real data"""
    # Formats temperature with proper precision
    # Updates location with full country info
    # Shows weather condition description
    # Updates input field with clean city name
```

#### Background Effects

```python
def apply_weather_background_effect(self, condition):
    """Apply background effects based on weather"""
    # Maps weather conditions to color overlays
    # Applies Hunter theme color palette
    # Creates immersive weather experience
```
